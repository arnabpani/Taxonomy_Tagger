Technical Specification: API Gateway Implementation

Document ID: TS-API-001  
Version: 1.2
Author: Technical Architecture Team
Date: February 2024

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the technical requirements and implementation details for the new API Gateway that will serve as the central entry point for all microservices in our cloud-native architecture.

1.2 Scope  
The API Gateway will handle:
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling  
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and analytics
- Circuit breaker functionality

2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Functional Requirements

FR-001: Request Routing
The gateway must route incoming requests to appropriate backend services based on:
- URL path patterns
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Header values
- Query parameters

FR-002: Load Balancing
- Support round-robin, least-connections, and IP hash algorithms
- Health check backend services every 30 seconds
- Automatic failover to healthy instances
- Weighted routing for canary deployments

FR-003: Authentication & Authorization
- Support OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens
- Integration with existing LDAP directory
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for external partners

FR-004: Rate Limiting
- Configurable rate limits per API endpoint
- Support for different limits based on client type
- Burst handling with token bucket algorithm
- 429 status code response for rate limit exceeded

2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-001: Performance
- Response time: <100ms for routing decisions
- Throughput: Support minimum 10,000 requests/second
- Concurrent connections: Support up to 50,000 concurrent connections

NFR-002: Availability
- Uptime requirement: 99.95%  
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Multi-zone deployment support

NFR-003: Security
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Security headers injection

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

3.1 High-Level Architecture
The API Gateway will be deployed as a containerized application using:
- Container orchestration: Kubernetes
- Service mesh: Istio for inter-service communication  
- Load balancer: Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Database: Redis cluster for session storage and caching

3.2 Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Go 1.21
- Web Framework: Gin HTTP framework
- Database: Redis 7.0 cluster mode
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Container: Docker with Alpine Linux base

4. API ENDPOINTS

4.1 Management APIs

GET /health
- Description: Health check endpoint
- Response: 200 OK with system status

GET /metrics  
- Description: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Response: Metrics in Prometheus format

POST /config/reload
- Description: Reload configuration without restart
- Authentication: Admin token required

4.2 Proxy APIs

All client requests will be proxied through patterns:
- /api/v1/users/* → User Service
- /api/v1/orders/* → Order Service  
- /api/v1/products/* → Product Service
- /api/v1/payments/* → Payment Service

5. CONFIGURATION

5.1 Environment Variables
- GATEWAY_PORT: Service listening port (default: 8080)
- REDIS_URL: Redis connection string
- LOG_LEVEL: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT validation
- RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT: Default requests per second limit

5.2 Configuration File (gateway.yaml)
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  read_timeout: 30s
  write_timeout: 30s

routing:
  rules:
    - path: /api/v1/users/*
      target: http://user-service:8080
      methods: [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]
    - path: /api/v1/orders/*  
      target: http://order-service:8080
      methods: [GET, POST, PUT]

rate_limiting:
  default_rps: 100
  burst_size: 200
  
auth:
  jwt_secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
  token_expiry: 3600s
```

6. DEPLOYMENT

6.1 Kubernetes Deployment
- Deployment: 3 replicas minimum
- Resource requests: 100m CPU, 256Mi memory
- Resource limits: 500m CPU, 512Mi memory
- Readiness probe: GET /health
- Liveness probe: GET /health

6.2 Monitoring & Alerting
- CPU usage > 80% for 5 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% for 2 minutes  
- Error rate > 5% for 1 minute
- Response time > 500ms for 2 minutes

7. TESTING STRATEGY

7.1 Unit Testing
- Test coverage requirement: >90%
- Mock external dependencies
- Test all routing logic and transformations

7.2 Integration Testing  
- End-to-end API flow testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Rate limiting verification
- Load testing with 10,000 concurrent users

7.3 Security Testing
- OWASP security scanning
- Penetration testing
- SSL/TLS configuration validation

8. MAINTENANCE

8.1 Logging
- All requests logged with correlation IDs
- Error logs with stack traces
- Structured logging in JSON format
- Log retention: 30 days

8.2 Monitoring Metrics
- Request count by endpoint
- Response time percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th)
- Error rate by status code
- Active connections count
