Purpose and Scope
This policy establishes the framework for protecting corporate information assets, systems, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third parties who have access to corporate information systems and data.

Information Asset Classification
All corporate information assets must be classified according to their sensitivity and business impact. The classification levels are:

Public: Information intended for public consumption with no restrictions on disclosure.
Internal: Information intended for internal use within the organization but not confidential.
Confidential: Sensitive information that could harm the organization if improperly disclosed.
Restricted: Highly sensitive information requiring the highest level of protection.

Access Control and Authentication
Access to information systems must be based on the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions. All system access must be authenticated through multi-factor authentication mechanisms. User accounts must be regularly reviewed and access rights adjusted based on role changes or employment status.

Password Management Requirements
All users must adhere to strong password policies including minimum length requirements, complexity standards, and regular password changes. Passwords must not be shared, written down, or stored in unsecured locations. Default passwords on all systems and devices must be changed immediately upon installation or configuration.

Network Security Controls
Network infrastructure must be protected through multiple layers of security controls including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation. All network traffic must be monitored and logged for security analysis. Wireless networks must implement strong encryption and authentication mechanisms.

Data Protection and Privacy
Personal and sensitive corporate data must be protected through encryption, access controls, and secure handling procedures. Data retention policies must be established and enforced to ensure data is only kept for as long as necessary. Data sharing with external parties must be governed by appropriate agreements and security requirements.

Incident Response Procedures
All security incidents must be reported immediately to the Information Security team. A formal incident response plan must be maintained and regularly tested to ensure effective response to security breaches. Incident documentation and lessons learned must be captured to improve future response capabilities.

Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Critical business processes and systems must have documented backup and recovery procedures. Regular backup testing must be conducted to ensure data can be restored when needed. Disaster recovery plans must be maintained and tested annually to verify the organization's ability to continue operations following a significant disruption.

Vendor and Third-Party Management
All vendors and third parties with access to corporate systems or data must undergo security assessments and agree to appropriate security requirements. Contracts must include specific security clauses and the right to audit compliance with security standards. Vendor access must be regularly reviewed and terminated when no longer required.

Employee Training and Awareness
All employees must complete security awareness training upon hiring and annually thereafter. Training must cover current security threats, company policies, and best practices for protecting information assets. Specialized training must be provided to employees with elevated access or security responsibilities.

Physical Security Requirements
Physical access to facilities containing sensitive information or systems must be controlled and monitored. Visitor access must be supervised and documented. Equipment containing sensitive data must be properly secured when not in use and sanitized before disposal or transfer.

Mobile Device and Remote Access
Mobile devices accessing corporate systems must meet security standards including encryption, authentication, and remote wipe capabilities. Remote access must be conducted through approved secure connections with appropriate authentication. Personal devices used for business purposes must comply with established security requirements.

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
The organization must maintain compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards including but not limited to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOX. Regular compliance assessments must be conducted and any deficiencies promptly addressed. Documentation must be maintained to demonstrate compliance efforts.

Security Monitoring and Logging
All systems must generate security logs that are centrally collected and monitored for suspicious activity. Log retention periods must align with regulatory requirements and business needs. Security monitoring tools must be deployed to detect and alert on potential security threats.

Policy Violations and Enforcement
